title: Ariadne GraphQL Chat Example
---

We have created the [Ariadne GraphQL Chat Example](https://github.com/mirumee/ariadne-graphql-chat-example) repository on GitHub that expands the [Chat example from "Subscriptions" documentation](/docs/subscriptions#simple-chat-example) with chat history, React.js client (using [Apollo-Client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/data/subscriptions/)), Redis for Broadcaster's messaging backend and Uvicorn HTTP/WebSocket server.

Our intention behind it is to provide a practical learning tool for Ariadne users and a foundation for future experimentation with new implementations and changes to subscriptions in future versions of Ariadne and third party WebSocket handlers.
