If an annotation couldn\'t be resolved, an auto-rebuild is performed during the first validation attempt. Because of this, we\'re removing all `model_rebuild` calls from the generated package.\\n\\n## Generating only used inputs and enums\\n\\nVersion 0.11 introduces 2 new configuration flags that can be used to reduce the number of unused generated models:\\n\\n- `include_all_inputs` (defaults to `true`) - when set to `true` the generated package will include a model for every input defined in the schema, otherwise it will only generate inputs used by defined operations.\\n\\n- `include_all_enums` (defaults to `true`) - specifies whether to include all enums defined in the schema, or only those used in operations.\\n\\n## `NoReimportsPlugin`\\n\\nIn 0.11, we are adding `NoReimportsPlugin` to the `ariadne_codegen.contrib` package. It removes the contents of the generated `__init__.py`. This is useful in scenarios where the generated package contains so many Pydantic models that the client\'s eager initialisation of the entire package on first import is very slow.\\n\\n## Including `operationName` in payload\\n\\nThe generated client methods will now pass the name of the operation as the `operation_name` argument to the `execute` and `execute_ws` methods of the base client. For example:\\n\\n```python\\nasync def list_all_users(self, **kwargs: Any) -> ListAllUsers:\\n    query = gql(\\n        \\"\\"\\"\\n        query ListAllUsers {\\n          users {\\n            id\\n          }\\n        }\\n        \\"\\"\\"\\n    )\\n    variables: Dict[str, object] = {}\\n    response = await self.execute(\\n        query=query, operation_name=\\"ListAllUsers\\", variables=variables, **kwargs\\n    )\\n    data = self.get_data(response)\\n    return ListAllUsers.model_validate(data)\\n```\\n\\nDefault base clients will also include the given `operation_name` as `operationName` in the sent payload.\\n\\n## Payload without `data`, but with `errors` key\\n\\nWe have changed the base clients to raise `GraphQLClientGraphQLMultiError` instead of `GraphQLClientInvalidResponseError` for payloads without `data` but with `errors` key.\\n\\n## Renamed invalid response error\\n\\nTo match the convention of other exceptions included with the base default clients, we have renamed `GraphQLClientInvalidResponseError` to `GraphQLClientInvalidResponseError` (with a capital `L`).\\n\\n## Changelog\\n\\n- Removed `model_rebuild` calls for generated input, fragment and result models.\\n- Added `NoReimportsPlugin` that makes the `__init__.py` of generated client package empty.\\n- Added `include_all_inputs` config flag to generate only inputs used in supplied operations.\\n- Added `include_all_enums` config flag to generate only enums used in supplied operations.\\n- Added `operationName` to payload sent by generated client\'s methods.\\n- Fixed base clients to pass `mypy --strict` without installed optional dependencies.\\n- Renamed `GraphQlClientInvalidResponseError` to `GraphQLClientInvalidResponseError` (breaking change).\\n- Changed base clients to raise `GraphQLClientGraphQLMultiError` for payloads with `errors` key but no `data` (breaking change)."},{"id":"/2023/11/15/ariadne-codegen-0-10","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2023/11/15/ariadne-codegen-0-10","source":"@site/blog/2023-11-15-ariadne-codegen-0-10.md","title":"Ariadne Codegen 0.10","description":"Ariadne Codegen 0.10 has been released!","date":"2023-11-15T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"readingTime":4.14,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"title":"Ariadne Codegen 0.10"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Ariadne Codegen 0.11","permalink":"/blog/2023/12/05/ariadne-codegen-0-11"},"nextItem":{"title":"Ariadne 0.21","permalink":"/blog/2023/11/08/ariadne-0-21-0"}},"content":"Ariadne Codegen 0.10 has been released!\\n\\nThis release improves the snake case conversion of operation names, adds opt-in support for Open Telemetry tracing, introduces the `ExtractOperationsPlugin` plugin, adds Python 3.12 to the supported versions, and brings other features and fixes.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Converting capitalized names and digits to snake case (breaking change)\\n\\nCodegen converts given operation name to snake case. Result will later be used as name of a file containing generated models for operation, optionally (if `convert_to_snake_case` is set to `true`) also as client\'s method name. This release introduces changes to how numbers and capitalised names are handled in the conversion process, e.g:\\n\\n| operation name   | old snake case         | new snake case     |\\n| ---------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------ |\\n| name             | name                   | name               |\\n| operationName    | operation_name         | operation_name     |\\n| operationNAME    | operation_n_a_m_e      | operation_name     |\\n| OPERATIONName    | o_p_e_r_a_t_i_o_n_name | operation_name     |\\n| operationName123 | operation_name123      | operation_name_123 |\\n| operationNAME123 | operation_n_a_m_e123   | operation_name_123 |\\n\\nThis is potentially a breaking change and may require changes in code using generated client.\\n\\n## Open Telemetry tracing\\n\\n`0.10` ships with two additional base clients that support the Open Telemetry tracing. When the `opentelemetry_client` configuration option is set to `true`, the default included base client is replaced with one that implements the opt-in Open Telemetry support - `BaseClientOpenTelemetry`/`AsyncBaseClientOpenTelemetry`. By default this support does nothing, but if the `opentelemetry-api` package is installed and the `tracer` argument is provided, then the client will create spans with data about requests made.\\n\\nTracing arguments accepted by `BaseClientOpenTelemetry`:\\n\\n- `tracer`: `Optional[Union[str, Tracer]] = None` - tracer object or name to pass to the `get_tracer` method\\n- `root_context`: `Optional[Context] = None` - optional context added to the root span\\n- `root_span_name`: `str = \\"GraphQL Operation\\"` - name of the root span\\n\\n`AsyncBaseClientOpenTelemetry` supports the same arguments as `BaseClientOpenTelemetry`, but also accepts additional arguments regarding websockets:\\n\\n- `ws_root_context`: `Optional[Context] = None` - optional context added to root span for websocket connection\\n- `ws_root_span_name`: `str = \\"GraphQL Subscription\\"` - name of root span for websocket connection\\n\\n## Included comments\\n\\nIn `0.10` we changed the `include_comments` option to allow selection of the style of comments to be included at the top of each generated file. Available options:\\n\\n- `\\"timestamp\\"` - comment with generation timestamp\\n- `\\"stable\\"` - comment with message that this is a generated file (new default)\\n- `\\"none\\"` - no comments\\n\\nPrevious boolean support is deprecated and will be dropped in future releases, but for now `false` is mapped to `\\"none\\"` and `true` to `\\"timestamp\\"`.\\n\\n## `ExtractOperationsPlugin`\\n\\nVersion `0.10` adds `ExtractOperationsPlugin` to the `ariadne_codegen.contrib` package. It moves query strings from the generated client\'s methods into a separate `operations.py` module and changes the generated client to import these definitions instead. The generated module name can be customized by adding `operations_module_name=\\"custom_name\\"` to the `[tool.ariadne-codegen.operations]` section in config.

To fix this, we are again changing the way custom scalars are represented in the generated package. We are removing `scalars.py`, the related option and plugin hooks. Instead, scalars will be represented directly as provided types.\\n\\n### Custom scalar without custom parse and serialize\\n\\n```toml\\n[tool.ariadne-codegen.scalars.SCALARA]\\ntype = \\"str\\"\\n```\\n\\nEach occurrence of `SCALARA` is represented as `str`.\\n\\n```toml\\n[tool.ariadne-codegen.scalars.DATETIME]\\ntype = \\"datetime.datetime\\"\\n```\\n\\nIn this case, `DATETIME` is treated in the same way, but the necessary import is added: `from datetime import datetime`.\\n\\n### Custom scalar with custom parse and serialize\\n\\n```toml\\n[tool.ariadne-codegen]\\n...\\nfiles_to_include = [\\".../type_b.py\\"]\\n\\n[tool.ariadne-codegen.scalars.SCALARB]\\ntype = \\".type_b.TypeB\\"\\nparse = \\".type_b.parse_b\\"\\nserialize = \\".type_b.serialize_b\\"\\n```\\n\\n`SCALARB` is represented as `TypeB`, but annotated according to its specific usage.\\n\\nIn models representing input types it will be annotated with `PlainSerializer`. This allows the user to create an input model with an existing `TypeB` instance, and serialization will take place automatically during query execution.\\n\\n```py\\n# inputs.py\\n\\nclass TestInput(BaseModel):\\n    value_b: Annotated[TypeB, PlainSerializer(serialize_b)]\\n```\\n\\n```py\\nb = TypeB(...)\\ntest_input = TestInput(value_b=b)\\n```\\n\\nIn result models `TypeB` will be annotated with `BeforeValidator`, which will use `parse_b` to deserialize `TypeB`\\\\`s data from the server.\\n\\n```py\\n# get_b.py\\n\\nclass GetB(BaseModel):\\n    query_b: Annotated[TypeB, BeforeValidator(parse_b)]\\n```\\n\\n```py\\nasync with Client(...) as client:\\n    b_data = await client.get_b()\\n\\nassert isinstance(b_data.query_b, TypeB)\\n```\\n\\nIf `SCALARB` is used as the type of the operation argument, it will be represented as an unannotated `TypeB`, but `serialize_b` will still be used in `variables` dict.\\n\\n```py\\n# client.py\\n\\nclass Client(AsyncBaseClient):\\n    async def test_mutation(self, value: TypeB) -> TestMutation:\\n        ...\\n        variables: Dict[str, object] = {\\n            \\"value\\": serialize_b(value),\\n        }\\n        ...\\n```\\n\\n## Pydantic\\\\`s warnings\\n\\nBy default, Pydantic gives a warning if the name of a field starts with `model_`, but throws an error if there is a collision with an existing attribute. In the last release we took care of the collisions and now we are changing the configuration of `BaseModel` to not give these warnings.\\n\\n## Nullable directives\\n\\nCodegen detects `@skip\' and `@include\' directives and marks fields with them as `Optional`, even if the type is not nullable. With pydantic v1 this worked fine, but with v2 there is an error if the response does not include a key for such a field. To maintain previous functionality, we will add an explicit `None` default for fields with one of these directives.\\n\\n## Operation string with nested inline fragments\\n\\nVersion `0.9` fixes the way we generate the operation string for the case where fragments are only used within an inline fragment. From now on we include these nested fragments.\\n\\n## Changelog\\n\\n- Fixed generating operation string for nested inline fragments.\\n- Removed scalars module. Changed generated models and client to use annotated types for custom scalars. Removed `scalars_module_name` option. Removed `generate_scalars_module`, `generate_scalars_cod`, `generate_scalar_annotation` and `generate_scalar_imports` plugin hooks.\\n- Removed pydantic warnings for fields with `model_` prefix.\\n- Fixed generating result types with nullable directives."},{"id":"/2023/08/22/ariadne-codegen-0-8","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2023/08/22/ariadne-codegen-0-8","source":"@site/blog/2023-08-22-ariadne-codegen-0-8.md","title":"Ariadne Codegen 0.8","description":"Ariadne Codegen 0.8 has been released!","date":"2023-08-22T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"readingTime":3.37,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"title":"Ariadne Codegen 0.8"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Ariadne Codegen 0.9","permalink":"/blog/2023/09/11/ariadne-codegen-0-9"},"nextItem":{"title":"GraphQL Gathering EU in Berlin","permalink":"/blog/2023/07/10/graphql-gathering"}},"content":"Ariadne Codegen 0.8 has been released!\\n\\nThis release brings support for file uploads, pydantic v2 compliance, improved custom scalars handling, and few other features and fixes.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## File uploads\\n\\nFrom now on, the default base client (sync or async) checks if any part of `variables` is an instance of `Upload`. If such an instance is found, the client sends a multipart request according to [GraphQL multipart request specification](https://github.com/jaydenseric/graphql-multipart-request-spec). `Upload` is a class that stores necessary data about the file:\\n\\n```python\\nclass Upload:\\n    def __init__(self, filename: str, content: IOBase, content_type: str):\\n        self.filename = filename\\n        self.content = content\\n        self.content_type = content_type\\n```\\n\\nIt is part of the generated client, and can be imported from it:\\n\\n```python\\nfrom {target_package_name} import Upload\\n```\\n\\nBy default, this class represents the graphql scalar `Upload`, but using custom scalar configuration, it can also be used for other scalars, e.g:\\n\\n```toml\\n[tool.ariadne-codegen.scalars.OTHERSCALAR]\\ntype = \\"Upload\\"\\n```\\n\\n## Pydantic v2\\n\\nVersion `0.8` changes the supported version of `pydantic` to `>=2.0.0,<3.0.0`. List of changes in the generated client:\\n\\n- Renamed `parse_obj` to `model_validate`.\\n- Renamed `dict` to `model_dump`.\\n- Preconfigured `BaseModel` uses `model_config` attribute instead of `Config` class.\\n- Renamed `update_forward_refs` to `model_rebuild`.\\n- Changed json encoder used by default base clients from `pydantic.json.pydantic_encoder` to `pydantic_core.to_jsonable_python`.\\n- Optional input fields now have an explicit default `None` value (if the schema doesn\'t specify another value).\\n\\n## Improved custom scalars\\n\\nIn `0.8`, we removed custom scalar logic from the preconfigured `BaseModel`, instead using pydantic\'s `BeforeValidator` and `PlainSerializer`. Now for every custom scalar provided in `pyproject.toml`, we generate an annotation that is used in generated arguments, results, and input models.\\n\\nExample of generated annotations:\\n\\n```toml\\n[tool.ariadne-codegen]\\n...\\nfiles_to_include = [\\".../type_b.py\\"]\\n\\n[tool.ariadne-codegen.scalars.SCALARA]\\ntype = \\"str\\"\\n\\n[tool.ariadne-codegen.scalars.DATETIME]\\ntype = \\"datetime.datetime\\"\\n\\n[tool.ariadne-codegen.scalars.SCALARB]\\ntype = \\".type_b.TypeB\\"\\nparse = \\".type_b.parse_b\\"\\nserialize = \\".type_b.serialize_b\\"\\n```\\n\\n```py\\n# scalars.py\\n\\nfrom datetime import datetime\\nfrom typing import Annotated\\n\\nfrom pydantic import BeforeValidator, PlainSerializer\\n\\nfrom .type_b import TypeB, parse_b, serialize_b\\n\\nSCALARA = str\\nDATETIME = datetime\\nSCALARB = Annotated[TypeB, PlainSerializer(serialize_b), BeforeValidator(parse_b)]\\n```\\n\\n`BaseModel` no longer depends on `scalars.py`, so now we can customize file name through the `scalars_module_name` option.\\n\\nScalars file has complellty different structure, so we removed `generate_scalars_parse_dict` and `generate_scalars_serialize_dict` plugin hooks. Instead, we introduced `generate_scalar_annotation` and `generate_scalar_imports` hooks.\\n\\n## Mixin directive\\n\\nAriadne Codegen 0.8 brings support for using the `mixin` directive on fragment definitions.\\n\\nFor example, given this fragment definition:\\n\\n```gql\\nfragment fragmentA on TypeA @mixin(from: \\".mixins\\", import: \\"MixinA\\") {\\n  fieldA\\n}\\n```\\n\\nGenerated `FragmentA` will inherit from `MixinA`:\\n\\n```python\\n# fragments.py\\n\\nfrom .base_model import BaseModel\\nfrom .mixins import MixinA\\n\\n\\nclass FragmentA(BaseModel, MixinA):\\n    field_a: int = Field(alias=\\"fieldA\\")\\n```\\n\\nAdditionally, from now on, the `mixin` directive will be excluded from the operation string, which is sent to a graphql server.\\n\\n## Field names\\n\\nVersion `0.8` introduces improvements in generating field names. It will append `_` to generated field name that would be already reserved by pydantic `BaseModel`\'s methods and attributes.\\n\\nWe also added handling of field names which consist only of underscores. It will be generated as `underscore_named_field_`. This behavior has the lowest priority in our name processing, so such a field\'s name can be altered by using an alias or utilizing `process_name` plugin hook.\\n\\n## Unified annotations\\n\\nWe changed the generated client to use `typing.Dict` and `typing.List` instead of `dict` and `list`. That way, used annotations don\'t prevent using a generated client with older versions of Python.\\n\\n## Changelog\\n\\n- Added support for `Upload` scalar. Added support for file uploads to `AsyncBaseClient` and `BaseClient`.\\n- Added validation of defined operations against the schema.\\n- Removed `mixin` directive from fragment string included in operation string sent to server.\\n- Added support for `mixin` directive on fragments definitions.\\n- Added support for fragments defined on subtype of field\'s type.\\n- Added default representation for a field name consisting only of underscores.\\n- Changed generated client and models to use pydantic v2.\\n- Changed custom scalars implementation to utilize pydantic\'s `BeforeValidator` and `PlainSerializer`. Added `scalars_module_name` option. Replaced `generate_scalars_parse_dict` and `generate_scalars_serialize_dict` with `generate_scalar_annotation` and `generate_scalar_imports` plugin hooks.\\n- Unified annotations in generated client to be compatible with python < 3.9.\\n- Fixed generating default values of input types from remote schemas.\\n- Changed generating of input and result field names to add `_` to names reserved by pydantic."},{"id":"/2023/07/10/graphql-gathering","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2023/07/10/graphql-gathering","source":"@site/blog/2023-07-10-graphql-gathering.md","title":"GraphQL Gathering EU in Berlin","description":"On the 4th of July Mirumee organized the GraphQL Gathering EU event together with The Guild, Saleor, Stellate, Escape and Hasura and support from the GraphQL Foundation.","date":"2023-07-10T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"readingTime":3.72,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"title":"GraphQL Gathering EU in Berlin"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Ariadne Codegen 0.8","permalink":"/blog/2023/08/22/ariadne-codegen-0-8"},"nextItem":{"title":"Ariadne 0.20.1","permalink":"/blog/2023/06/27/ariadne-0-20-1"}},"content":"On the 4th of July Mirumee organized the GraphQL Gathering EU event together with The Guild, Saleor, Stellate, Escape and Hasura and support from the GraphQL Foundation.\\n\\nThis event took place in Spielfeld Digital Hub in Berlin. It used the unconference format where instead of a series of talks the attendees first submit the topics for discussion, then those topics are divided between three time slots, and people join the designated tables to discuss those based on their own interests.\\n\\nBetween those tables and talks in corridors, we\'ve got a few takeaways that we\'ve found relevant to the Ariadne and GraphQL developers using it.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Performance metrics\\n\\nAriadne out of the box provides extensions for enabling the Open Telemetry and Open Tracing metrics. Those extensions work by wrapping in telemetry spans all calls of custom resolvers by the GraphQL engine.\\n\\nDuring the Gathering and and even before we\'ve heard an opinion that this approach to GraphQL metrics is not good, as it fills the APM software with tons of data which can be best described as noise. Better approach postulated is having developers themselves implement those traces explicitly in resolvers they like to track performance of.\\n\\nWe are not planning to drop OpenTelemetry (or OpenTracing) extensions from Ariadne, but we may consider updating the existing documentation with a short note that the out of the box approach may not be what they want. Maybe the solution to the issue of having a lot of noise in metrics would be the `fields` option on extensions, enabling developers to limit them only to selected fields?\\n\\n## Persisted queries\\n\\nOne of GraphQL\'s selling points is getting only the data you\'ve queried for. But what about situations when this control should be reversed, and it\'s the server which should decide on fields to return it? One could go about implementing a separate REST or RPC API on the side, but now they need to maintain two separate APIs which can be considered grossly suboptimal.\\n\\nOne proposed solution to this issue is introduction of persisted queries to GraphQL. The idea is if GraphQL server received `operationName` within its payload, but not `query`, it would look up the list of predefined operations on its side using the name received. It would then either return an error, or run a query from persisted operation. This enables GraphQL to act as both the GraphQL API, but also, when needed, an RPC server.\\n\\nThis idea requires further development as there are still questions that need answering like how should stored procedures be discoverable by the clients in introspections.\\n\\nAriadne could provide limited support for persisted queries inside the `ariadne.contrib` package.\\n\\n## Query complexity and cost checks\\n\\nOne discussion we\'ve had at the Gathering was about the query complexity and validation. Ariadne implements a query cost validator that will calculate query cost and prevent query execution when a predefined limit is exceeded. However this topic is little more, well, complex than setting those costs limits:\\n\\n- The biggest offenders are deep queries exploiting cycles within schema. Queries like products list -> category -> category products list -> reviewers -> reviewed products list. Prevent those from happening by avoiding fields returning lists outside of `Query` and `Mutation` results types.\\n- When in doubt, make fields returning lists paginated.\\n- Consider writing a GraphQL validator that limits the number of fields from `Query` or `Mutation` that can be queried in a single operation.\\n- Understand your users. Slow queries may not be the end of the world when they happen rarely. Maybe clients are looking for an easy way to pull a bunch of data to avoid waterfalls and you can improve the schema for them? Or maybe those clients are maintained by people sitting in the next room in the office and the issue may be resolved by asking nicely? Not every problem must be an engineering one.\\n\\n## Combining and composing APIs in single GraphQL schema\\n\\nFew weeks ago we launched the Ariadne GraphQL Proxy - our (prototype) solution for the problem of combining multiple APIs under a single GraphQL endpoint.\\n\\nDuring the Gathering we\'ve participated in a few discussions on the subject that gave us both ideas for future improvements to the API, but also understanding of priorities people have when implementing GraphQL gateways. We understand now people expect to be able to deploy those solutions as part of their CDN layer (like CloudFlare workers), to easily repackage OpenAPI compliant APIs as GraphQL, and to be able to quickly enable caching for hot paths."},{"id":"/2023/06/27/ariadne-0-20-1","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2023/06/27/ariadne-0-20-1","source":"@site/blog/2023-06-27-ariadne-0-20-1.md","title":"Ariadne 0.20.1","description":"Ariadne 0.20.1 has been released.","date":"2023-06-27T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"readingTime":0.16,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"title":"Ariadne 0.20.1"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"GraphQL Gathering EU in Berlin","permalink":"/blog/2023/07/10/graphql-gathering"},"nextItem":{"title":"Ariadne 0.20","permalink":"/blog/2023/06/21/ariadne-0-20-0"}},"content":"Ariadne 0.20.1 has been released.\\n\\n0.20.1 is a bugfix release that updates the GraphiQL template to use new URL for explorer plugin, if its enabled through the `explorer_plugin=True` option.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e"},{"id":"/2023/06/21/ariadne-0-20-0","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2023/06/21/ariadne-0-20-0","source":"@site/blog/2023-06-21-ariadne-0-20-0.md","title":"Ariadne 0.20","description":"Ariadne 0.20 has been released!","date":"2023-06-21T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"readingTime":3.92,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"title":"Ariadne 0.20"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Ariadne 0.20.1","permalink":"/blog/2023/06/27/ariadne-0-20-1"},"nextItem":{"title":"Introducing Ariadne GraphQL Proxy","permalink":"/blog/2023/06/15/ariadne-graphql-proxy"}},"content":"Ariadne 0.20 has been released!\\n\\nThis release removes support for Python 3.7, adds Open Telemetry extension, deprecates Open Tracing and Apollo Tracing extensions.\\n\\nIt also includes bugfixes, new configuration options and updated GraphQL extensions that should perform better than previous ones in asynchronous servers.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Dropped Python 3.7 support\\n\\nPython 3.7 reaches end of life on 27 June 2023, but we are already experiencing some of Ariadne\'s tests failing for it due to the dependencies being ahead of us in dropping support.\\n\\nAriadne 0.20 drops support for Python 3.7. It may still work on Python 3.7, we will not test against it anymore and bugs and crashes specific to it will not be addressed.\\n\\n## New extensions implementation\\n\\n> **Note:** This is a breaking change. See the [middleware](/server/Extensions/middleware) document for new guide for developers.\\n\\nIn the past Ariadne shipped with both synchronous and asynchronous GraphQL extensions. Our users reported that asynchronous extensions suffered from performance issues, which we\'ve attempted to resolve together with the community through extra configuration options enabling exclusion of specified fields from tracing, but this didn\'t lead to noticeable improvements.\\n\\nWe\'ve received an important tip from Christoph Zwerschke, developer of the `GraphQL-core 3` library which powers Ariadne\'s GraphQL implementation. In short, using asynchronous middleware resulted in every GraphQL field becoming asynchronous, even those excluded from tracing. Async/await in Python is generally fast enough, but it\'s overhead is non-negligible, especially for thousands of calls that happen during GraphQL query execution.\\n\\nAriadne 0.20 adds a benchmarks suite to the project. This suite allowed us to measure the performance hit on no-op asynchronous GraphQL extension (around 1.66 times slower than baseline query execution on Python 3.11).\\n\\nIn this release we have also dropped separate implementations for asynchronous and synchronous extensions. Ariadne\'s GraphQL extensions are now always synchronous, but in scenarios where the GraphQL resolver or its return value is asynchronous, those extensions return asynchronous closure for GraphQL\'s query executor to evaluate.\\n\\nQuick results from last benchmarks are:\\n\\n- 1x: GraphQL query execution without any extensions enabled.\\n- 1.1x slower: GraphQL query execution with single no-op extension enabled.\\n- 1.31x slower: GraphQL query execution with single extension enabled, using the `OpenTelemetry` extension.\\n\\nWe are happy with those gains and hope that our community will share our optimism at this change, even if the extensions system becomes more complex for extension developers.\\n\\nDocumentation for extensions and middleware was updated accordingly to explain the performance pitfall of using async extensions and new way to implement extensions that support both async and sync resolvers.\\n\\n### Migrating existing projects to new extensions\\n\\nTo update your project to use new extensions:\\n\\n- replace `OpenTracingSync` with `OpenTracing`.\\n- replace `opentracing_extension_sync` with `opentracing_extension`.\\n- replace `ApolloTracingSync` with `ApolloTracing`.\\n\\n`ExtensionSync` base class was also removed from Ariadne. Please use `Extension` as base class for custom extensions. See the [middleware](/server/Extensions/middleware) document for the guide for new middlewares what support both async and sync execution.\\n\\n## Deprecated Open Tracing and Apollo Tracing\\n\\nThe Open Tracing standard has been deprecated and is superseded by the Open Telemetry.\\n\\nApollo Tracing was deprecated by Apollo, with new a APM solution available but not supported by Ariadne.\\n\\nBoth of those extensions will be dropped in future release of Ariadne.\\n\\n## New features\\n\\nAriadne\'s `ASGI` and `WSGI` applications now implement new `query_validator` option that enables customization of GraphQL query validation process.\\n\\nAdded `OpenTelemetry` and `opentelemetry_extension` extensions for enabling the Open Telemetry APM for GraphQL servers. Those are importable from `ariadne.tracing.opentelemetry`.\\n\\n## Bugs fixed\\n\\nFixed `ERROR` message in GraphQL-WS protocol having invalid payload type. This error occurred in a limited number of cases but was still a pain point for scenarios where Ariadne was used for GraphQL subscriptions.\\n\\nAriadne\'s GraphQL query cost validator did not handle the inline fragments.

We generate them as async generators, which means that we don\'t support subscriptions when the generated client is not async (`async_client` is set to `false`).\\n\\nFor example, given the following operation:\\n\\n```gql\\nsubscription GetUsersCounter {\\n  usersCounter\\n}\\n```\\n\\nGenerated client will have following method:\\n\\n```py\\n    async def get_users_counter(self) -> AsyncIterator[GetUsersCounter]:\\n        query = gql(\\n            \\"\\"\\"\\n            subscription GetUsersCounter {\\n              usersCounter\\n            }\\n            \\"\\"\\"\\n        )\\n        variables: dict[str, object] = {}\\n        async for data in self.execute_ws(query=query, variables=variables):\\n            yield GetUsersCounter.parse_obj(data)\\n```\\n\\nOur default async base client uses [websockets](https://github.com/python-websockets/websockets) package and implements [graphql-transport-ws](https://github.com/enisdenjo/graphql-ws/blob/master/PROTOCOL.md) subprotocol.\\n\\nRequired dependencies can be installed with pip:\\n\\n```\\n$ pip install ariadne-codegen[subscriptions]\\n```\\n\\n## Fragments\\n\\nIn previous versions of Codegen fragments were \\"unpacked\\" in queries. For example, given the following operations:\\n\\n```gql\\nquery GetA {\\n  getTypeA {\\n    ...FragmentA\\n  }\\n}\\n\\nquery ListA {\\n  listTypeA {\\n    ...FragmentA\\n  }\\n}\\n\\nfragment FragmentA on TypeA {\\n  id\\n  name\\n}\\n```\\n\\nGenerated `get_a.py` and `list_a.py` files had types looking like this:\\n\\n```py\\n# get_a.py\\n\\nclass GetA(BaseModel):\\n    get_type_a: \\"GetAGetTypeA\\" = Field(alias=\\"GetTypeA\\")\\n\\n\\nclass GetAGetTypeA(BaseModel):\\n    id: str\\n    name: str\\n```\\n\\n```py\\n# list_a.py\\n\\nclass ListA(BaseModel):\\n    list_type_a: List[\\"ListAListTypeA\\"] = Field(alias=\\"ListTypeA\\")\\n\\n\\nclass ListAListTypeA(BaseModel):\\n    id: str\\n    name: str\\n```\\n\\nBoth of these operations use the same `FragmentA` to represent `TypeA`, but generated models didn\'t reflect that.\\n\\nTo make working with fragments easier, in Ariadne Codegen 0.7 we are changing this behavior. Instead of unpacking fragments, we generate separate models from them and use those as mixins. The above operation will now result in 3 files being generated: `get_a.py`, `list_a.py`, and `fragments.py`\\n\\n```py\\n# get_a.py\\n\\nclass GetA(BaseModel):\\n    get_type_a: \\"GetAGetTypeA\\" = Field(alias=\\"GetTypeA\\")\\n\\n\\nclass GetAGetTypeA(FragmentA):\\n    pass\\n```\\n\\n```py\\n# list_a.py\\n\\nclass ListA(BaseModel):\\n    list_type_a: List[\\"ListAListTypeA\\"] = Field(alias=\\"ListTypeA\\")\\n\\n\\nclass ListAListTypeA(FragmentA):\\n    pass\\n```\\n\\n```py\\n# fragments.py\\n\\nclass FragmentA(BaseModel):\\n    id: str\\n    name: str\\n```\\n\\nWith this change you can use fragments as reusable types in your Python logic using the client, eg. `def process_a(a: FragmentA)...`. New `fragments.py` consists of fragments collected from all parsed operations.\\n\\n### Unions and Interfaces\\n\\nThere is an exception from new fragments behaviour. If a fragment represents `Union` then we unpack it as before:\\n\\n```gql\\nquery getAnimal {\\n  animal {\\n    ...AnimalData\\n  }\\n}\\n\\nfragment AnimalData on AnimalInterface {\\n  name\\n  ... on Dog {\\n    dogField\\n  }\\n  ... on Cat {\\n    catField\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nFor the above fragment, this Python code will be generated:\\n\\n```py\\nclass GetAnimal(BaseModel):\\n    animal: Union[\\n        \\"GetAnimalAnimalAnimalInterface\\", \\"GetAnimalAnimalDog\\", \\"GetAnimalAnimalCat\\"\\n    ] = Field(discriminator=\\"typename__\\")\\n\\n\\nclass GetAnimalAnimalAnimalInterface(BaseModel):\\n    typename__: Literal[\\"AnimalInterface\\", \\"Fish\\"] = Field(alias=\\"__typename\\")\\n    name: str\\n\\n\\nclass GetAnimalAnimalDog(BaseModel):\\n    typename__: Literal[\\"Dog\\"] = Field(alias=\\"__typename\\")\\n    name: str\\n    dog_field: str = Field(alias=\\"dogField\\")\\n\\n\\nclass GetAnimalAnimalCat(BaseModel):\\n    typename__: Literal[\\"Cat\\"] = Field(alias=\\"__typename\\")\\n    name: str\\n    cat_field: str = Field(alias=\\"catField\\")\\n```\\n\\n## `ShorterResultsPlugin`\\n\\nIn version 0.7 we are including `ShorterResultsPlugin` developed by our community. It can be used when operations have only one top-level field. For example, given the following operation:\\n\\n```gql\\nquery GetUser($userId: ID!) {\\n  user(id: $userId) {\\n    id\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nFrom this operation, the generated method looks like this:\\n\\n```py\\nasync def get_user(self, user_id: str) -> GetUser:\\n    query = gql(\\n        \\"\\"\\"\\n        query GetUser($userId: ID!) {\\n            user(id: $userId) {\\n                id\\n            }\\n        }\\n        \\"\\"\\"\\n    )\\n    variables: dict[str, object] = {\\"userId\\": user_id}\\n    response = await self.execute(query=query, variables=variables)\\n    data = self.get_data(response)\\n    return GetUser.parse_obj(data)\\n```\\n\\nTo get the value of `user`, we need to always get it by attribute, eg. `await get_user(\\"1\\").user`. By using `ShorterResultsPlugin` our `get_user` returns the value of `user` directly.\\n\\n```toml\\n[tool.ariadne-codegen]\\n...\\nplugins = [\\"ariadne_codegen.contrib.shorter_results.ShorterResultsPlugin\\"]\\n```\\n\\n```py\\nasync def get_user(self, user_id: str) -> GetUserUser:\\n    ...\\n    return GetUser.parse_obj(data).user\\n\\n```\\n\\n## Discriminated unions\\n\\nTo ensure that data is represented as a correct class we use pydantic\'s [discriminated unions](https://docs.pydantic.dev/dev-v2/usage/types/unions/#discriminated-unions-aka-tagged-unions). We add `__typename` to queries with unions and then use its value as `discriminator`. Let\'s take an example schema and query:\\n\\n```gql\\ntype Query {\\n  animal: Animal!\\n}\\n\\ninterface Animal {\\n  name: String!\\n}\\n\\ntype Dog implements Animal {\\n  name: String!\\n  dogField: String!\\n}\\n\\ntype Cat implements Animal {\\n  name: String!\\n  catField: String!\\n}\\n\\ntype Fish implements Animal {\\n  name: String!\\n}\\n```\\n\\n```gql\\nquery GetAnimal {\\n  animal {\\n    name\\n    ... on Dog {\\n      dogField\\n    }\\n    ... on Cat {\\n      catField\\n    }\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nFrom this query and operation, we generate following types:\\n\\n```py\\nclass GetAnimal(BaseModel):\\n    animal: Union[\\n        \\"GetAnimalAnimalAnimal\\", \\"GetAnimalAnimalDog\\", \\"GetAnimalAnimalCat\\"\\n    ] = Field(discriminator=\\"typename__\\")\\n\\n\\nclass GetAnimalAnimalAnimal(BaseModel):\\n    typename__: Literal[\\"Animal\\", \\"Fish\\"] = Field(alias=\\"__typename\\")\\n    name: str\\n\\n\\nclass GetAnimalAnimalDog(BaseModel):\\n    typename__: Literal[\\"Dog\\"] = Field(alias=\\"__typename\\")\\n    name: str\\n    dog_field: str = Field(alias=\\"dogField\\")\\n\\n\\nclass GetAnimalAnimalCat(BaseModel):\\n    typename__: Literal[\\"Cat\\"] = Field(alias=\\"__typename\\")\\n    name: str\\n    cat_field: str = Field(alias=\\"catField\\")\\n```\\n\\nWe added `typename__` to this query, and by its value pydantic determines which model to choose.\\n\\n## Leading underscores\\n\\nAriadne Codegen 0.7 will remove leading `_` from field names. Fields with `_` are ignored by pydantic and it is impossible to save the value of such fields.\\n\\n## Removal of `mixin` directive from operation sent to a server\\n\\nWe support a custom `mixin` directive, which allows extending of generated types. In 0.7 we are removing it from the operation string included in generated client\'s methods. This directive is only used in the process of generation and caused servers to return errors because of an unknown directive.\\n\\n## `process_schema` plugin hook\\n\\nPlugins can now define a `process_schema` hook to change schema before Codegen uses it for generation. From now on we allow invalid schemas to be parsed from files or URLs, and then we call this plugin hook. After `process_schema` is finished, the processed schema must pass `graphql.assert_valid_schema` validation.\\n\\nFor example, it can be used to add Apollo Federation directives definitions:\\n\\n```py\\nclass MyPlugin:\\n    def process_schema(self, schema: GraphQLSchema) -> GraphQLSchema:\\n        extends_directive_def = GraphQLDirective(...)\\n        schema.directives += (extends_directive_def, )\\n\\n        return schema\\n```\\n\\n## Changelog\\n\\n- Added support for subscriptions as async generators.\\n- Changed how fragments are handled to generate separate module with fragments as mixins.\\n- Fixed `ResultTypesGenerator` to trigger `generate_result_class` for each result model.\\n- Changed processing of models fields to trim leading underscores.\\n- Added `ShorterResultsPlugin` to standard plugins.\\n- Fixed handling of inline fragments inside other fragments.\\n- Changed generated unions to use pydantic\'s discriminated unions feature.\\n- Replaced HTTPX\'s `json=` serializer for query payloads with pydantic\'s `pydantic_encoder`.\\n- Removed `mixin` directive from operation string sent to server.\\n- Fixed `ShorterResultsPlugin` that generated faulty code for discriminated unions.\\n- Changed generator to ignore unused fragments which should be unpacked in queries.\\n- Changed type hints for parse and serialize methods of scalars to `typing.Any`.\\n- Added `process_schema` plugin hook."},{"id":"/2023/04/18/ariadne-codegen-0-6","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2023/04/18/ariadne-codegen-0-6","source":"@site/blog/2023-04-18-ariadne-codegen-0-6.md","title":"Ariadne Codegen 0.6","description":"Ariadne Codegen 0.6 has been released!","date":"2023-04-18T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"readingTime":1.55,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"title":"Ariadne Codegen 0.6"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Ariadne Codegen 0.7","permalink":"/blog/2023/06/01/ariadne-codegen-0-7"},"nextItem":{"title":"Ariadne Codegen 0.5","permalink":"/blog/2023/04/05/ariadne-codegen-0-5"}},"content":"Ariadne Codegen 0.6 has been released!\\n\\nThis release brings further improvements and fixes to issues reported to us by our amazing community.

To customize or replace the GraphQL Playground, one had to create custom class inheriting from `GraphQL` and implement their own `render_playground` method.\\n\\nIn Ariadne 0.18 GraphQL explorers have been made into separate Python classes. To customize the explorer in your server, pass instance of `Explorer` class implementing the GraphQL explorer UI you wish to use to the `explorer` option of `GraphQL` class.\\n\\nAriadne 0.18 ships with following GraphQL explorers out of the box:\\n\\n- GraphiQL 2\\n- Apollo Sandbox\\n- GraphQL Playground\\n\\nIn addition to implementing GraphQL explorers, those classes also provide different configuration options specific to their explorer.\\n\\nImplementing custom explorers is also supported!\\n\\nSee [the explorers guide](/server/Docs/explorers) for more details.\\n\\n### GraphiQL 2 as default GraphQL explorer\\n\\nBecause GraphQL Playground is officially no longer maintainer, [GraphiQL 2](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql) is now a default GraphQL explorer in Ariadne.\\n\\nGraphQL Playground is still available as an option.\\n\\n### Disabling the GraphQL explorer\\n\\nAriadne now provides the `ExplorerHttp405` GraphQL explorer which actually doesn\'t implement any UI at all, but instead triggers the `405 not allowed` response from the GraphQL server when explorer is accessed.\\n\\nThis is now the official way for disabling the GraphQL explorer UI in Ariadne.\\n\\n## New approach for managing different name cases between Python and GraphQL\\n\\nLeading naming convention in Python is `PascalCase` for types and `snake_case` for attributes (and frequently dict keys). This causes conflict with GraphQL where fields are usually named using the `camelCase`.\\n\\nAriadne ships with `snake_case_fallback_resolvers` and `convert_kwargs_to_snake_case` utilities to create this convention automatically in places where no explicit convention was already specified by developer, namely in custom resolvers.\\n\\nAriadne 0.18 adds `convert_schema_names` option to `make_executable_schema` that sets this conversion automatically for entire schema:\\n\\n- Fields without custom resolvers set on them\\n- Fields arguments\\n- Inputs fields\\n\\nSee the [name case conversion guide](/server/Docs/case-conversion) to learn more about this feature.\\n\\nSee the [reference](/server/API-reference/api-reference#convert_camel_case_to_snake) for details on algorithm used by Ariadne to convert `camelCase` names to `snake_cases`.\\n\\n`snake_case_fallback_resolvers`, `convert_kwargs_to_snake_case` as well as `FallbackResolversSetter` and `fallback_resolvers` are now deprecated and will be removed from Ariadne in future version. We understand that migrating away from them may take a while for Ariadne\'s users, so we plan to keep those for few more months at least before announcing the final version those will be part of.\\n\\n## Better integration story for FastAPI and Starlette\\n\\nInstances of the `asgi.GraphQL` class now expose the `handle_request` and `handle_websocket` methods which can be called from Starlette\'s and FastAPI\'s routes. This alternative approach to `mount`ing the `GraphQL` as subapplication is intended to offer better integration in projects that rely heavily on other services or FastAPI\'s dependency injection.\\n\\nAriadne\'s documentation has been updated to show both of those use cases:\\n\\n- [FastAPI](/server/Integrations/fastapi-integration)\\n- [Starlette](/server/Integrations/starlette-integration)\\n\\n## Dataloaders support for synchronous servers\\n\\nAriadne\'s public API was updated to support custom GraphQL execution contexts. This enables use of synchronous dataloaders in Ariadne.\\n\\nSee the [dataloaders guide](/server/Docs/dataloaders) to learn more about dataloaders and see the code examples.\\n\\n## Updated reference documents\\n\\nWe have replaced all documents in existing \\"API Reference\\" section with new ones that are wholly generated from Ariadne\'s source code.\\n\\nThis makes them 100% accurate and much more useful to the developers already familiar with GraphQL development with Ariadne, but looking to learn about APIs and features not covered by other documents, or just to refresh their memory of the APIs.\\n\\n## Backwards incompatible changes\\n\\n### `context_value` function is now called with two arguments\\n\\n`context_value` is now called with two arguments instead of one:\\n\\n- `request`: an representation of HTTP request specific to the framework used.\\n- `data`: an unvalidated JSON which may be a valid GraphQL request payload.\\n\\nCurrently Ariadne supports both old and new functions, but it will show a warning when old function is used. To future-proof your function you can change it\'s signature from `request` to `request, *_`.\\n\\nSee the [`ContextValue` reference](/server/API-reference/types-reference#contextvalue).\\n\\n### `root_value` function is now called with four arguments\\n\\n`root_value` is now called with four arguments instead of one:\\n\\n- `context_value`: a context value specific to this GraphQL server.\\n- `operation_name`: a str with name of operation to execute (or None).\\n- `variables`: a dict with variables to pass to query\'s resolvers (or None).\\n- `document`: a DocumentNode with parsed GraphQL query.\\n\\nCurrently Ariadne supports both old and new functions, but it will show a warning when old function is used. To future-proof your function you can change it\'s signature from `context` to `context, *_`.\\n\\nSee the [`RootValue` reference](/server/API-reference/types-reference#rootvalue).\\n\\n### `middleware` option now expects a list of middlewares or callable returning list of middlewares\\n\\n`middleware` option now expects a list of middlewares or callable returning list of middlewares.\\n\\nThis is in line with documentation that always described this use.\\n\\nIf you relied on custom `MiddlewareManager`, you can still pass it to Ariadne through the `middleware_manager_class` option that was added as part of this change.\\n\\n## Other improvements\\n\\nThere are few other improvements that we\'ve found noteworthy for Ariadne 0.18:\\n\\n`logger` option now supports `Logger` and `LoggerAdapter` instances in addition to `str` with logger name.\\n\\n[`load_schema_from_path`](/server/API-reference/api-reference#load_schema_from_path) now supports `Path`-like objects in addition to `str` with path to schema.\\n\\n[`query_parser`](/server/API-reference/types-reference#queryparser) option now enables replacement of default query parser used with custom one.\\n\\n## Security guide\\n\\nExcellent folk from [the Escape](https://escape.tech/) have contributed the security guide for GraphQl to Ariadne\'s docs.\\n\\nYou can find it [here](/server/Security/security-overview).\\n\\n## Changelog\\n\\n- GraphiQL2 is now default API explorer.\\n- Added `explorer` option to ASGI and WSGI `GraphQL` applications that enables API explorer customization.\\n- Added `ExplorerHttp405` API explorer that returns `405 Method Not Allowed` for GET HTTP requests.\\n- Added implementations for GraphiQL2, GraphQL-Playground and Apollo Sandbox explorers.\\n- Added `convert_names_case` option to `make_executable_schema` to convert all names in schema to Python case using default or custom strategy.\\n- Added support for `Path`-like objects to `load_schema_from_path`.\\n- Changed `logger` option to also support `Logger` and `LoggerAdapter` instance in addition to `str` with logger name.\\n- Added support for `@tag` directive used by Apollo Federation.\\n- Moved project configuration from `setup.py` to `pyproject.toml`.\\n- Changed `context_value` option in ASGI and WSGI applications for callables to take query data as second argument.\\n- Changed `root_value` option in ASGI and WSGI applications for callables to take operation and and variables in addition to context and parsed query.\\n- Added `execution_context_class` option to ASGI and WSGI applications.\\n- Added `query_parser` option to ASGI and WSGI `GraphQL` applications that enables query parsing customization.\\n- Changed `middleware` option to work with callable or list of middlewares instead of `MiddlewareManager` instance.\\n- Added `middleware_manager_class` option to ASGI and WSGI applications.\\n- Added `handle_request` and `handle_websocket` methods to `ASGI` application that takes Starlette/FastAPI `Request` and `Websocket` objects.\\n- Fixed type annotations for middlewares.\\n- Added docstrings to members of public API."},{"id":"/2023/02/02/ariadne-codegen","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2023/02/02/ariadne-codegen","source":"@site/blog/2023-02-02-ariadne-codegen.md","title":"Announcing Ariadne Codegen!","description":"Ariadne Codegen!","date":"2023-02-02T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"readingTime":4,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"title":"Announcing Ariadne Codegen!"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Ariadne 0.18","permalink":"/blog/2023/02/21/ariadne-0-18"},"nextItem":{"title":"Ariadne 0.17.1","permalink":"/blog/2023/01/09/ariadne-0-17-1"}},"content":"![Ariadne Codegen!](assets/ariadne-codegen.jpg)\\n\\nToday we are announcing first release of [Ariadne Codegen](https://github.com/mirumee/ariadne-codegen)!\\n\\nAriadne Codegen is our solution for the problem of writing and maintaining a Python boilerplate code for GraphQL clients. It\'s a code generator that converts GraphQL queries into production ready GraphQL client for Python.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## The story\\n\\nAriadne Codegen was created from our need for better solution for GraphQL Clients. At [Mirumee Software](https://mirumee.com) we are writing a lot of Python services that integrate with or extend [Saleor](https://graphql.com/saleor/saleor), our GraphQL-first e-commerce software.\\n\\nThis means we are writing a lot of GraphQL clients, and a lot of those clients follow same structure:\\n\\n- There\'s a module that evolves into a package named `saleor_client`.\\n- This client implements functions like `get_shipping_methods` or `create_checkout` that map 1:1 to GraphQL queries and mutations implemented by Saleor.\\n- Each of those functions takes arguments it packages into a variables dictionary and combines them with Python string containing a GraphQL query.\\n- Each of those functions then does a `POST` request, handles errors and returns the result.\\n\\nBasically, we wrote functions upon a functions upon a functions that looked like this:\\n\\n```python\\nasync def create_checkout(client, email: str,  lines: dict, address: Address):\\n    address_json = address.json()\\n\\n    variables = {\\n        \\"channel\\": \\"USD\\",\\n        \\"email\\" email,\\n        \\"lines\\": [\\n            {\\"variantId\\": variant, \\"quantity\\": quantity}\\n            for variant, quantity in lines.items()\\n        ],\\n        \\"shippingAddress\\": address,\\n        \\"billingAddress\\": address,\\n    }\\n\\n    query = \\"\\"\\"\\n    mutation CheckoutCreate($input: CheckoutCreateInput!) {\\n        checkoutCreate(input: $input) {\\n            checkout {\\n                id\\n            }\\n            errors {\\n                field\\n                message\\n                code\\n                variants\\n                lines\\n                addressType\\n            }\\n        }\\n    }\\n    \\"\\"\\"\\n\\n    result = await client.post(\\n        GRAPHQL_URL,\\n        json={\\n            \\"query\\": query,\\n            \\"operationName\\": \\"CheckoutCreate\\",\\n            \\"variables\\": {\\"input\\": variables}\\n        }\\n    )\\n\\n    # Repackages HTTP errors from httpx into errors like\\n    # `SaleorAuthenticationError`\\n    raise_saleor_error(result)\\n\\n    data = await result.json()\\n\\n    if data.get(\\"errors\\"):\\n        # Repackage GraphQL errors\\n        raise_graphql_error(data[\\"errors\\"])\\n\\n    return data[\\"checkoutCreate\\"][\\"checkout\\"][\\"id\\"]\\n```\\n\\nThere\'s actually a very little variety in logic of those functions, and many of them are created by copying an already existing function and changing the variables and query string. For functions that return an objects, we would also maintain Pydantic models so we have result data packaged as types with code suggestions and MyPy checks instead of dicts and lists.\\n\\n### Automatization\\n\\nVery quickly we\'ve started to experiment with different approaches to automating this away:\\n\\n- Code generator which is aware of the GraphQL schema and converted GraphQL operations into a Python package.\\n- An WSDL-like client for GraphQL which also is aware of the GraphQL schema but did it\'s logic on the fly.\\n\\nFirst approach had a downside of requiring package to be regenerated on every new or changed query, but it had three upsides that we liked:\\n\\n- It didn\'t have extra logic executed on the runtime, making it **faster**.\\n- It\'s behavior didn\'t change on the runtime, making it easy to **learn and debug**.\\n- Generated code played nicely with code suggestions in IDEs and Mypy without need for any extra work.\\n\\nAriadne Codegen has grown from a complete rewrite of the original code generator that was created and used internally by a member of the Saleor Integrations Team.\\n\\n## Ariadne Codegen\\n\\nAriadne Codegen can be installed with pip:\\n\\n```\\n$ pip install ariadne-codegen\\n```\\n\\nThis will give you a new command, `ariadne-codegen`, which consumes the `ariadne-codegen` configuration from the `pyproject.toml` file.\\n\\nMinimum required configuration is just paths to where the schema and queries are:\\n\\n```\\n[ariadne-codegen]\\nschema_path = \\"schema.graphql\\"\\nqueries_path = \\"queries.graphql\\"\\n```\\n\\nCreate `schema.graphql`:\\n\\n```graphql\\ntype Query {\\n  hello: String!\\n}\\n```\\n\\nCreate `queries.graphql`:\\n\\n```graphql\\nquery GetHello {\\n  hello\\n}\\n```\\n\\nNow run the codegen:\\n\\n```\\n$ ariadne-codegen\\n```\\n\\nNew directory `graphql_client` will be created for you.

In past releases Starlette dependency was always pinned to a specific version, which forced new Ariadne release whenever new Starlette minor version was released.\\n\\nStarting with Ariadne 0.17, Starlette dependency is specified as `<1.0`. Reasoning for this is that Ariadne only uses Starlette\'s ASGI implementation and no other features and in last 4 years of project\'s existence there was a single case when Starlette\'s update forced Us to change our implementation - early in 2019.\\n\\n## Removed `cgi` dependency\\n\\n`cgi` module is part of Python\'s standard library, providing utilities for writing HTTP servers. Ariadne\'s WSGI implementation used this module for extracting uploaded files from requests payloads.\\n\\nStarting with Python 3.11, `cgi` module is now deprecated and Ariadne was moved to custom implementation using [python-multipart](https://github.com/andrew-d/python-multipart) library, and uploaded files are now instances of `File` class.\\n\\n## `asgi-file-uploads` optional dependency renamed to `file-uploads`\\n\\nBecause both ASGI and WSGI implementation now requires `python-multipart` library, `asgi-file-uploads` was renamed to `file-uploads`. To make upgrade easier, both names are currently supported by Ariadne, but projects dependencies should be changed for Ariadne 0.18 which will drop `asgi-file-uploads`.\\n\\n## Python 3.11\\n\\nStarting with this release Ariadne is tested against Python 3.11.\\n\\n## CHANGELOG\\n\\n- Bumped starlette dependency in setup.py to `<1.0`.\\n- Added Python 3.11 to test matrix.\\n- Removed usage of deprecated `cgi` module.\\n- Renamed `asgi-file-uploads` optional dependency to `file-uploads`."},{"id":"/2022/09/26/ariadne-0-16-1","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2022/09/26/ariadne-0-16-1","source":"@site/blog/2022-09-26-ariadne-0-16-1.md","title":"Ariadne 0.16.1","description":"Ariadne 0.16.1 is now available.

Just remember that we **don\'t consider current API stable** and we plan to iterate and change things based on our own experience with it and feedback from other users.\\n\\nWe don\'t know yet if in future we will merge modules code into Ariadne proper. For the time being we want to maintain it as a separate library so we can make frequent releases as bugs are discovered and improvements are found.\\n\\n## Feedback\\n\\nWe\'d **LOVE** to hear what you think about Ariadne GraphQL Modules.

Originally it was our goal to have good Django support in the core, but we\'ve quickly migrated our Ariadne GraphQL APIs to ASGI frameworks like Starlette and FastAPI. This resulted in us having to maintain three backends (ASGI, WSGI and Django).\\n\\nThis also had three additional downsides, each worsened by previous one:\\n\\n- It tied releases of fixes to Django to Ariadne.\\n- It made people try contributing additional features and improvements to Django GraphQL support to Ariadne instead of releasing them as their own libs.\\n- It sent message to other frameworks communities that they can expect support for their frameworks to eventually appear under `ariadne.contrib` (eg. `ariadne.contrib.flask`), while we would like those communities to develop and maintain those as their own libraries.\\n\\nThank you for your understanding. \u{1F64F}\\n\\n> Please note that `ariadne_django` package is currently looking for maintainers.\\n>\\n> As copyright holders for `ariadne.contrib.django` and it\'s documentation, we also offer our backing to initiative for extracting this code into library under\\n\\n## Updated Starlette dependency to 0.17.1\\n\\nUsually we don\'t single updated dependencies, but we\'ve got a word that old Starlette version that Ariadne used caused conflict with recent versions of FastAPI.\\n\\nThis issue should now be resolved.\\n\\n## Changelog\\n\\n- Added `on_connect` and `on_disconnect` options to `ariadne.asgi.GraphQL`, enabling developers to run additional initialization and cleanup for websocket connections.\\n- Updated Starlette dependency to 0.17.1.\\n- Added support for multiple keys for GraphQL federations.\\n- Made `Query` type optional in federated schemas.\\n- Updated default resolvers to test for `Mapping` instead of `dict`.\\n- Removed `ariadne.contrib.django`.

This is useful when complexity should be calculated using the value of field belonging to input type, eg:\\n\\n```graphql\\ntype Query {\\n  users(pagination: PaginationInput): UsersListPage!\\n}\\n\\ninput PaginationInput {\\n  pageSize: Int!\\n}\\n```\\n\\n```python\\ncost_map = {\\n    \\"Query\\": {\\n        \\"users\\": {\\"complexity\\": 1, \\"multipliers\\": [\\"pagination.pageSize\\"]},\\n    },\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThank you T.Kameyama for [contributing this](https://github.com/mirumee/ariadne/pull/410)!\\n\\n## Improved `convert_kwargs_to_snake_case` and `snake_case_fallback_resolvers`.\\n\\nAriadne\'s case conversion mechanic is a hot topic for developers and new release brings improvements to this feature contributed by two users.\\n\\nStarting with 0.13 release, Ariadne\'s case conversion utils now recognize both numbers and acronyms:\\n\\n- `testWithUPPERPart` is now converted to `test_with_upper_part`.\\n- `test134part` is now converted to `test_134_part`.\\n\\nThank you both [Ben Motz](https://github.com/mirumee/ariadne/pull/452) and [nilsdet](https://github.com/mirumee/ariadne/pull/451) for contributing those improvements!\\n\\n## CHANGELOG\\n\\n- Updated `graphQL-core` requirement to 3.1.3.\\n- Added support for Python 3.9.\\n- Added support for using nested variables as cost multipliers in the query price validator.\\n- `None` is now correctly returned instead of `{\\"__typename\\": typename}` within federation.\\n- Fixed some surprising behaviors in `convert_kwargs_to_snake_case` and `snake_case_fallback_resolvers`."},{"id":"/2020/08/04/ariadne-0-12-0","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2020/08/04/ariadne-0-12-0","source":"@site/blog/2020-08-04-ariadne-0-12-0.md","title":"Ariadne 0.12.0","description":"This one took us a while, but Ariadne 0.12 is now available!","date":"2020-08-04T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"readingTime":3.2,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"title":"Ariadne 0.12.0"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Ariadne 0.13.0","permalink":"/blog/2021/03/17/ariadne-0-13-0"},"nextItem":{"title":"Ariadne 0.11.0","permalink":"/blog/2020/04/01/ariadne-0-11-0"}},"content":"This one took us a while, but Ariadne 0.12 is now available!\\n\\nAriadne 0.12 is a feature release that adds support for custom query validators, adds query cost validator that enables developers to limit maximum complexity of GraphQL query that can be executed by the server, and adds an option for disabling the GraphQL introspection and the GraphQL Playground IDE on servers.\\n\\nThis release also locks required GraphQL core version at 3.0. Support for 3.1 is coming in future version.\\n\\nFinally, this release also adds `extensions` support to the Django view, and fixes a reported bug in `ScalarType` default `parse_literal` producing an error when GraphQL query contained both literal and query variables.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Custom query validators and query cost validator\\n\\nIt is now possible to implement custom GraphQL query validators. This is an advanced feature intended for developers who need to block malicious GraphQL queries from being executed by their server.\\n\\nOut of the box, Ariadne includes a [query cost validator](/server/Extensions/query-validators) that enables developers to assign costs values to GraphQL fields in the schema and limit size or complexity of a single GraphQL query that may be executed by the server.\\n\\n## Added `introspection` option in ASGI, WSGI apps and Django view\\n\\nOne of the most requested features of Ariadne was an option to disable GraphQL Playground. This request had its basis on security concerns, however, disabling GraphQL Playground in Ariadne would not prevent malicious users from using a local GraphQL API client like Insomnia or the desktop version of GraphQL Playground to continue interacting with the API.\\n\\nThis is because when users request the ability to disable GraphQL Playground, they in fact seek an option to disable introspection, a GraphQL feature enabling clients to query a GraphQL server to learn what types, fields, and mutations are implemented by its schema.\\n\\nThanks to a contribution from the community, Ariadne\'s ASGI app, the WSGI app, and the Django view now support an `introspection` argument. Setting this option to `False` will result in GraphQL Playground becoming unavailable and will also prevent any introspection queries from being executed by the server.\\n\\n## Fixed default `parse_literal` implementation in `ScalarType`\\n\\nGraphQL.js reference which is used in development of Ariadne didn\'t document that scalar\'s `parse_literal` method takes two arguments instead of one, with second argument being present when scalar\'s literal value was used in query that was also called with variable values.\\n\\nWe\'ve re-tested default behavior of GraphQL-Core library and found it already provides default `parse_literal` implementation mirroring Ariadne\'s one. In light of this we have removed default `parse_literal` from Ariadne\'s codebase and updated [scalars documentation](/server/Docs/scalars) to skip `parse_literal`. At later date we will follow up with new documentation exploring scenarios when custom `parse_literal` is useful.\\n\\n## Notice about `ariadne.contrib.django`\\n\\nAriadne ships with the `ariadne.contrib` package which, amongst different useful utils, includes a `django` package that implements a Django app complete with a GraphQL view and a few scalars specific to Django.\\n\\n**Today we would like to notify the community about our plan to split `ariadne.contrib.django` into a separate package. Ariadne 0.13 will be final Ariadne release to ship with `ariadne.contrib.django`.**\\n\\nWe are doing this to separate Ariadne releases from `ariadne.contrib.django` and also to set an example on how we are envisioning packages providing Ariadne integration with 3rd party web frameworks.\\n\\n## CHANGELOG\\n\\n- Added `validation_rules` option to query executors as well as ASGI and WSGI apps and Django view that allow developers to include custom query validation logic in their APIs.\\n- Added `introspection` option to ASGI and WSGI apps, allowing developers to disable GraphQL introspection on their server.\\n- Added `validation.cost_validator` query validator that allows developers to limit maximum allowed query cost/complexity.\\n- Removed default literal parser from `ScalarType` because GraphQL already provides one.\\n- Added `extensions` and `introspection` configuration options to Django view.\\n- Updated requirements list to require `graphql-core` 3."},{"id":"/2020/04/01/ariadne-0-11-0","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2020/04/01/ariadne-0-11-0","source":"@site/blog/2020-04-01-ariadne-0-11-0.md","title":"Ariadne 0.11.0","description":"No joke, today we are releasing Ariadne 0.11!","date":"2020-04-01T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"readingTime":2.01,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"title":"Ariadne 0.11.0"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Ariadne 0.12.0","permalink":"/blog/2020/08/04/ariadne-0-12-0"},"nextItem":{"title":"Ariadne 0.10.0","permalink":"/blog/2020/02/11/ariadne-0-10-0"}},"content":"No joke, today we are releasing Ariadne 0.11!\\n\\nAriadne 0.11 is an maintenance release focused on resolving few small but annoying issues reported by the community.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Removed support for sending queries and mutations via WebSocket\\n\\nFew weeks back we\'ve merged to Ariadne a change that enabled execution of GraphQL queries and mutations over the websocket connection - a feature implemented by some GraphQL client libraries such as [apollo-link-ws](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/link/links/ws/).\\n\\nOnly after release we have learned that logic testing if incoming GraphQL operation is subscription or not is incorrect, classifying correct subscription payloads sent by clients as queries, making it impossible to implement subscriptions in Ariadne 0.10.\\n\\nWe have decided to roll-back the change in 0.11, to make sure that subscriptions are still available to users that rely on them.\\n\\nWe have also added the feature to our [roadmap](https://github.com/mirumee/ariadne/issues/341) - contributions are welcome!\\n\\n## Unified default `info.context` value for WSGI to be dict with single `request` key\\n\\nThe type of default value of `info.context` differed between `ariadne.wsgi` and `ariadne.asgi`.\\n\\nWhile in ASGI it was a dict with single key `request` containing instance of current HTTP request, it in WSGI it was a dict containing HTTP request data as its attributes.\\n\\nCode examples in documentation assumed `info.context[\\"request\\"]` as means for accessing current HTTP request from resolver, which was source of confusion for those using Ariadne with WSGI.\\n\\nStarting with Ariadne 0.11, the default `context` value passed to resolvers is also dict with single key: `request`.

Both GraphQL-core and GraphQL-core-next are Python ports of reference GraphQL implementation, `graphql.js`. Key bit of difference between the two is the time at which they were developed, and thus Python features they support.\\n\\nGraphQL-core has started its life back in 2015 and supports Python 2.7, while work on GraphQL-core-next begun in 2018 and from day one it required Python 3.6 or 3.7 to work. It also supported then-new `asyncio` for improved query execution performance and proper [dataloader](https://github.com/syrusakbary/aiodataloader) pattern implementation in place of promises. It also had fully-typed codebase which made it much easier for us to reason about its codebase and develop custom abstractions on top of it.\\n\\nGraphQL-core was most famously used to build Graphene framework, which GraphQL-core-next has found wide use amongst the \\"new wave\\" of GraphQL libraries that came about in 2018.\\n\\nIt was always plan for GraphQL-core-next developers to eventually replace GraphQL-core as \\"default\\" Python GraphQL implementation and this has finally taken place on 30th November 2019 when GraphQL-core-next has been released as GraphQL-core 3.0.\\n\\nAriadne originally used GraphQL core for its implementation, but very quickly we\'ve made decision to move to core-next - something we\'ve never regretted as it enabled us to quickly adopt the new ecosystem of async web frameworks and libraries in our projects.\\n\\n## Upgrading to Ariadne 0.9\\n\\nBecause both GraphQL-core and GraphQL-core-next use the same `graphql` package name, it\'s required for projects using Ariadne to uninstall `Graphql-core-next` before upgrading their Ariadne dependency to 0.9.\\n\\n## CHANGELOG\\n\\n- Updated `graphql-core-next` to `graphql-core` 3."},{"id":"/2019/11/25/ariadne-0-8-0","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2019/11/25/ariadne-0-8-0","source":"@site/blog/2019-11-25-ariadne-0-8-0.md","title":"Ariadne 0.8.0","description":"Ariadne 0.8 release brings improvements to API modularization, makes python-multipart optional dependency, and updates dependencies to latest versions.

Developers may opt-in to install it by using `asgi-file-uploads` extra flag:\\n\\n```console\\npip install ariadne[asgi-file-uploads]\\n```\\n\\n## CHANGELOG\\n\\n- Added recursive loading of GraphQL schema files from provided path.\\n- Added support for passing multiple bindables as `*args` to `make_executable_schema`.\\n- Updated Starlette dependency to 0.13.\\n- Made `python-multipart` optional dependency for `asgi-file-uploads`.\\n- Added Python 3.8 to officially supported versions."},{"id":"/2019/10/03/ariadne-0-7-0","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2019/10/03/ariadne-0-7-0","source":"@site/blog/2019-10-03-ariadne-0-7-0.md","title":"Ariadne 0.7.0","description":"Ariadne 0.7 brings support for custom schema directives and synchronous extensions.","date":"2019-10-03T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"readingTime":2.22,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"title":"Ariadne 0.7.0"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Ariadne 0.8.0","permalink":"/blog/2019/11/25/ariadne-0-8-0"},"nextItem":{"title":"Ariadne 0.6.0","permalink":"/blog/2019/08/12/ariadne-0-6-0"}},"content":"Ariadne 0.7 brings support for custom schema directives and synchronous extensions.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Custom schema directives\\n\\nIn SDL, schema directives act as annotations adding extra information and meaning to schema\'s items.

Those two enable developers to exchange dates and datetimes between their UI and Python logic.\\n\\n## Error reporting improvements\\n\\nIn Ariadne 0.3 we\'ve introduced extended error formatting support that added error\'s backtrace and content to GraphQL response, making it so much easier to get to source of the problem when debugging resolvers.\\n\\nIn 0.4 we are further improving error reporting with introduction of error logging.\\n\\nInternally Ariadne creates own logger, and then logs all errors and exceptions to it, enabling you to stay on the top of the situation. We\'ve took extra care to make sure that logged errors contain not only information about field in GraphQL query that failed to resolve, but also actual exception data. It also plays good with existing error tracking systems like [Sentry](https://sentry.io):\\n\\n![Error logged to Sentry](assets/error-in-sentry.png)\\n\\n## Keeping you covered\\n\\nBased on feedback and reports we\'ve received from early adopters we\'ve added bunch of assertions and checks around our API to fail fast and let you spot your errors before your users do.\\n\\nAlso, because in 99% of cases custom scalar literal parser is just a thin wrapper unpacking value from AST `ValueNode` and passing for value_parser, Ariadne 0.4 will provide this mechanism for you out of the box. If you still need custom literal handling logic - you can still do it.\\n\\n## CHANGELOG\\n\\nAbove were only the highlights of this release. Here\'s complete changelog for those interested in nitty-gritty details:\\n\\n- Updated `graphql-core-next` to 1.0.4 which has feature parity with GraphQL.js 14.3.1 and better type annotations.\\n- `ariadne.asgi.GraphQL` is now an ASGI3 application.

This was achieved by updating the library\u2019s codebase to use [GraphQL-core-next](https://github.com/graphql-python/graphql-core-next) instead of GraphQL-core as its GraphQL implementation.\\n\\nThis GraphQL implementation was build using modern Python features and relies on asyncio for asynchronous query execution, meaning you can now use \u201Casync\u201D with your resolvers.\\n\\nDue to this change we\u2019ve also dropped support for Python 3.5 in Ariadne 0.2.0, now requiring Python 3.6 or 3.7.\\n\\n## New API\\n\\nWe are strong believers that library design should be simple to learn, but strict enough to not leave much room for developer error. In Ariadne 0.1.0 We relied on dicts for mapping resolvers to schema\u200A\u2014\u200Aan idea we\u2019ve took directly from the Apollo-Server:\\n\\n```python\\ndef resolve_users():\\n    # \u2026\\n\\nresolvers = {\\n    \u201CQuery\u201D: {\\n        \u201Cusers\u201D: resolve_users\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis looked like a good idea at first: the pattern is proven and widely adopted in software; it uses basic Python types and is easy to memorize.\\n\\nHowever, as soon as we moved to larger APIs, we found an issue in this approach; because Python doesn\u2019t allow functions to be declared inside dicts, developers quickly end up with a file containing a number of function definitions followed by one big dict mapping those resolvers to their schema. Because that dict was usually out of their focus, a pattern started to emerge in which a developer would declare resolvers but forget to update the dict, thus not adding those resolvers to schema and surprising/confusing the dev.\\n\\nAriadne 0.2.0 does away with this by introducing dedicated objects for mapping resolvers to GraphQL types:\\n\\n```python\\nfrom ariadne import ResolverMap\\n\\nquery = ResolverMap(\u201CQuery\u201D)\\n\\n@query.field(\u201Cusers\u201D)\\ndef resolve_users():\\n    # \u2026\\n```\\n\\nIn this new approach the resolver can be mapped to a declared sample field. This creates a more natural order of things: type -> field -> resolver.\\n\\nAs a bonus, ResolverMap also implements simple validation logic and will raise an error if a type or field doesn\u2019t exist in the schema.\\n\\nMake sure to check the [docs](/server/Docs/resolvers) for more examples and information about API changes.\\n\\n## Better interoperability with Apollo tools for developers\\n\\nAriadne now supports loading schema from \\\\*.graphql files, enabling developers to use an [Apollo GraphQL plugin for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=apollographql.vscode-apollo) when writing schema for their API.\\n\\nWe\u2019ve also created a PR (already merged and released!) that supports marking strings in Python code as GraphQL using a simple `gql()` function:\\n\\n![GQL syntax coloring in action](assets/gql-colors-gif.gif)\\n\\nIt\u2019s now not only an awesome GraphQL tooling and a first-class development experience for Python developers, it\u2019s also a single set of tools that can now be shared by backend and frontend developers while working on the same project.\\n\\nWe consider this a game-changer for software projects where a Python backend is developed together with a GraphQL frontend.\\n\\n## Setting the scene for 2019\\n\\nThe latest Ariadne release already has all the features required by real-world GraphQL API implementations\u2026 but we are not stopping there.\\n\\nIt is our goal to make the Python GraphQL experience as great as Node.js GraphQL. To achieve this end, we will continue improving Ariadne to offer a better developer experience and solve the ever-greater problem of space:\\n\\n- Iterate on our documentation to show you how to use Ariadne and how to develop GraphQL servers using good practices and patterns\\n- Deliver better abstractions for integration with existing server and framework libraries\\n- Implement solutions for patterns and problems not specific to the GraphQL core, like query cost validators or connection types\\n\\nWe have some great things in the pipeline we can\u2019t wait to show you!\\n\\n## Thank you!\\n\\nThanks so much for you response and engagement since the release; it has surprised and motivated us. Ariadne is open source and developed on [GitHub](https://github.com/mirumee/ariadne/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22); we invite folk to give it a look and check out the issues marked with \u201Chelp wanted\u201D.
