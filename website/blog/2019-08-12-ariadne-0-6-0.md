title: Ariadne 0.6.0
---

Ariadne 0.6 is now available, bringing bug fixes, extensions and support for application performance monitoring.

<!--truncate-->

## Extensions and middlewares

[Extensions support](/docs/extensions) is now available. Extensions can be used to add custom monitoring to the API, as well as inject custom logic into query execution process.

0.6 also formalizes our support for the [GraphQL middlewares](/docs/middlewares), which enable developers to wrap resolvers used by server with custom logic.

Extensions are only available in GraphQL servers running over the ASGI, but middlewares are supported by both ASGI and WSGI servers.

## Apollo tracing and OpenTracing monitoring extensions.

`ariadne.contrib.tracing` package has been added to the library that provides extensions for easy enabling application performance metrics in GraphQL Server.

[Apollo tracing](/docs/apollo-tracing) extension adds query's trace data to the results JSON. This data can then be viewed using the `TRACE` option in GraphQL Playground.

[OpenTracing](/docs/open-tracing) extension can be used to monitor GraphQL API for performance and errors using popular APM tools like [Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io) or [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/):

## CHANGELOG

- Updated `graphql-core-next` to 1.1.1 which has feature parity with GraphQL.js 14.4.0.
- Added basic extensions system to the `ariadne.graphql.graphql`. Currently only available in the `ariadne.asgi.GraphQL` app.
- Added `convert_kwargs_to_snake_case` utility decorator that recursively converts the case of arguments passed to resolver from `camelCase` to `snake_case`.
- Removed `default_resolver` and replaced its uses in library with `graphql.default_field_resolver`.
- Resolver returned by `resolve_to` util follows `graphql.default_field_resolver` behaviour and supports resolving to callables.
- Added `is_default_resolver` utility for checking if resolver function is `graphql.default_field_resolver`, resolver created with `resolve_to` or `alias`.
- Added `ariadne.contrib.tracing` package with `ApolloTracingExtension` and `OpenTracingExtension` GraphQL extensions for adding Apollo tracing and OpenTracing monitoring to the API (ASGI only).
- Updated ASGI app disconnection handler to also check client connection state.
- Fixed ASGI app `context_value` option support for async callables.
- Updated `middleware` option implementation in ASGI and WSGI apps to accept list of middleware functions or callable returning those.
- Moved error formatting utils (`get_formatted_error_context`, `get_formatted_error_traceback`, `unwrap_graphql_error`) to public API.
