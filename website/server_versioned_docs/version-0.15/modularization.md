Ariadne allows you to spread your GraphQL API implementation over multiple files, with different strategies being available for schema and resolvers.

> We've recently released [Ariadne GraphQL Modules](#using-ariadne-graphql-modules) library that provides new way to modularize large GraphQL schemas.


## Defining schema in `.graphql` files

The recommended way to define schema is by using `.graphql` files. This approach offers certain advantages:

- First class support from developer tools like [Apollo GraphQL plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=apollographql.vscode-apollo) for VS Code.
- Easier cooperation and sharing of schema design between frontend and backend developers.
- Dropping whatever python boilerplate code was used for SDL strings.

To load schema from a file or directory, you can use the `load_schema_from_path` utility provided by the Ariadne:

```python
from ariadne import load_schema_from_path
from ariadne.asgi import GraphQL

# Load schema from file...
type_defs = load_schema_from_path("/path/to/schema.graphql")

# ...or construct schema from all *.graphql files in directory
type_defs = load_schema_from_path("/path/to/schema/")

# Build an executable schema
schema = make_executable_schema(type_defs)

# Create an ASGI app for the schema
app = GraphQL(schema)
```

The above app won't be able to execute any queries but it will allow you to browse your schema.

`load_schema_from_path` validates syntax of every loaded file, and will raise an `ariadne.exceptions.GraphQLFileSyntaxError` if file syntax is found to be invalid.


## Defining schema in multiple modules

Because Ariadne expects `type_defs` to be either a string or list of strings, it's easy to split types across many string variables in many modules:

```python
query = """
    type Query {
        users: [User]!
    }
"""

user = """
    type User {
        id: ID!
        username: String!
        joinedOn: Datetime!
        birthDay: Date!
    }
"""

scalars = """
    scalar Datetime
    scalar Date
"""

schema = make_executable_schema([query, user, scalars])
```

The order in which types are defined or passed to `type_defs` doesn't matter, even if those types depend on each other.


## Defining types in multiple Python modules

GraphQL types definitions can be split across multiple modules or even packages, and combined using the `make_executable_schema`:


```console
myapp/
    __init__.py
    ...
    graphql/
        types/
            __init__.py
            book.py
            query.py
            user.py
        __init__.py
        scalars.py
        schema.py
```

GraphQL types can be defined in dedicated modules under `types` namespace and combined into a list in `types/__init__.py`:

```python
from .book import book
from .query import query
from .user import user

types = [query, book, user]
```

Because API defines only single custom scalar, using single `scalars.py` module can be enough:

```python
from ariadne import ScalarType


isbn = ScalarType("ISBN")

... # other code for isbn scalar
```

`schema.py` imports `types` list and single custom scalar, then passes those as `*args` to `make_executable_schema` to combine them into single schema:

```python
from .types import types
from .scalars import isbn

type_defs = ...  # valid type definitions

schema = make_executable_schema(type_defs, *types, isbn)
```

The order in which objects are passed to the `bindables` argument matters. Most bindables replace previously set resolvers with new ones, when more than one is defined for the same GraphQL type, with `InterfaceType` and fallback resolvers being exceptions to this rule.


## Using Ariadne GraphQL Modules

[Ariadne GraphQL Modules](https://github.com/mirumee/ariadne-graphql-modules) is library for Ariadne where every GraphQL object in your schema is defined as Python type:

```python
from datetime import date

from ariadne.asgi import GraphQL
from ariadne_graphql_modules import ObjectType, gql, make_executable_schema


class Query(ObjectType):
    # You can also do __schema__ = load_schema_from_path("/path/to/schema.graphql")
    __schema__ = gql(
        """
        type Query {
            message: String!
            year: Int!
        }
        """
    )

    @staticmethod
    def resolve_message(*_):
        return "Hello world!"

    @staticmethod
    def resolve_year(*_):
        return date.today().year


schema = make_executable_schema(Query)
app = GraphQL(schema=schema, debug=True)
```

This library provides multiple features like dependency graph and correctness check at definition time that make it easier to reason about and work with large schemas.
