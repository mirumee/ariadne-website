Ariadne 0.16 release brings refactor to Ariadne's ASGI app which makes it more modular and adds support for old and new GraphQL websocket protocols. It also updates `load_schema_from_path` to support `gql` and `graphqls` file types. Finally it bumps library's support for Starlette to version 0.20 and updates other dependencies to latest versions.

We thank our community for contributing features to this release. You rock! ❤️

## Refactored `ariadne.asgi.GraphQL`

`GraphQL`'s HTTP and WebSocket protocols support has been factored out to separate classes, making it easier to implement and customize HTTP and WebSocket handling.

### Updating to 0.16

If you are using subscriptions in your GraphQL API, you have to update your code:

```python
from ariadne.asgi import GraphQL
from ariadne.asgi.handlers import GraphQLWSHandler

app = GraphQL(
    schema,
    websocket_handler=GraphQLWSHandler(),
)
```

If you used event handlers for websocket connections, those should now be set on WebSocket handler directly:

```python
from ariadne.asgi import GraphQL
from ariadne.asgi.handlers import GraphQLWSHandler

app = GraphQL(
    schema,
    websocket_handler=GraphQLWSHandler(
        on_connect=...,
        on_disconnect=...,
        on_operation=...,
        on_complete=...,
    ),
)
```

## `gql` and `graphqls` support for `load_schema_from_path`

`load_schema_from_path` will now load files with `gql` and `graphqls` extensions in addition to `graphql`.

## CHANGELOG

- Refactored `ariadne.asgi.GraphQL` to use strategy pattern for handling HTTP and WebSockets.
- Updated `load_schema_from_path` to also support `.gql` and `.graphqls` files.
- Added support for `starlette` 0.20.
