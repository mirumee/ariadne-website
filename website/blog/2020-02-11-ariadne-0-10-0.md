title: Ariadne 0.10.0
---

We are happy to announce that Ariadne 0.10 is now available, bringing support for `Apollo Federation` to the library and adding the ability to send queries to the same channel as the subscription via WebSocket.

<!--truncate-->

## Apollo Federation

Ariadne now supports building federated schemas. This means that we can compose many GraphQL services built with Ariadne (or other GraphQL libraries), into a single data graph and use it as if it was implemented as a monolithic service.

```python
from ariadne import QueryType
from ariadne.asgi import GraphQL
from ariadne.contrib.federation import FederatedObjectType, make_federated_schema

type_defs = """
  type Query {
    me: User
  }

  type User @key(fields: "email") {
    id: ID!
    name: String
    email: String!
  }
"""

query = QueryType()
user = FederatedObjectType("User")


@user.reference_resolver
def resolve_user_reference(_, _info, representation):
    return get_user_by_email(representation.get("email"))


schema = make_federated_schema(type_defs, [query, user])
application = GraphQL(schema)
```

Many thanks to Delyan who [contributed this feature](https://github.com/mirumee/ariadne/pull/285). This is another time when community contributes such a large and much-requested feature to Ariadne. Thank you!
