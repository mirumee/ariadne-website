## Starting a local server

You will need an ASGI server such as [uvicorn](http://www.uvicorn.org/), [daphne](https://github.com/django/daphne/), or [hypercorn](https://pgjones.gitlab.io/hypercorn/):

```console
$ pip install uvicorn
```

Pass an instance of `ariadne.asgi.GraphQL` to the server to start your API server:

```python
from ariadne import make_executable_schema
from ariadne.asgi import GraphQL
from . import type_defs, resolvers

schema = make_executable_schema(type_defs, resolvers)
app = GraphQL(schema)
```

Run the server pointing it to your file:

```console
$ uvicorn example:app
```
