## Subscriptions support in GraphiQL explorer

Ariadne's GraphiQL explorer template has been updated with configuration necessary for GraphQL subscriptions.

You will still need to add subscriptions support to your server in order for those to work, but you will no longer have to rely on custom `GraphiQL` configuration to enable those in explorer.

## Changelog

- Added Python 3.12 to tested versions.
- Updated integration tests to run against FastAPI 0.104, Flask 3.0 and Starlette 0.32.
- Updated GraphiQL explorer to initialize with support for subscriptions.
