title: Ariadne 0.5.0
---

Just weeks after 0.4 we are now releasing Ariadne 0.5!

<!--truncate-->

This release is all about delivering one new feature to the developers: file uploads.

## File uploads

[File uploads](/server/Docs/file-uploads) are now available. Implementation follows the [GraphQL file uploads specification](https://github.com/jaydenseric/graphql-multipart-request-spec), which means that Ariadne is fully compatible with client uploading implementations like [apollo-upload-client](https://github.com/jaydenseric/apollo-upload-client).

## CHANGELOG

- Added support for file uploads.
