title: Ariadne 0.14.1
---


Ariadne 0.14.1 has been releaded!

0.14.1 is a maintenance release that locks `graphql-core` dependency version at `<3.2`, preventing Ariadne from crashing due to incompatibility with recently released GraphQL-core 3.2 package.

This release also removes `ariadne.contrib.django` package which by mistake made it's way to 0.14 release which was supposed to be first Ariadne release without it.

- Lock `GraphQL-core` requirement at <3.2.
