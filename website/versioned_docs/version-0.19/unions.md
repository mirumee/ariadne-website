When designing your API, you may run into a situation where you want your field to resolve to one of a few possible types. It may be an `error` field that can resolve to one of many error types, or an activity feed made up of different types.

The most obvious solution may be creating a custom "intermediary" type that would define dedicated fields to different types:

```graphql
type MutationResult {
    status: Boolean!
    validationError: ValidationError
    permissionError: AccessError
    user: User
}

type FeedItem {
    post: Post
    image: Image
    user: User
}
```

GraphQL provides a dedicated solution to this problem in the form of dedicated `Union` type.


## Union example

Consider an earlier error example. The union representing one of a possible three error types can be defined in schema like this:

```graphql
union Error = NotFoundError | AccessError | ValidationError
```

This `Error` type can be used just like any other type:

```graphql
type MutationResult {
    status: Boolean!
    error: Error
    user: User
}
```

Your union will also need a special resolver called a *type resolver*. This resolver will be called with an object returned from a field resolver and the current context.
It should return a string containing the name of a GraphQL type, or `None` if the received type is incorrect:

```python
def resolve_error_type(obj, *_):
    if isinstance(obj, ValidationError):
        return "ValidationError"
    if isinstance(obj, AccessError):
        return "AccessError"
    return None
```

> Returning `None` from this resolver will result in `null` being returned for this field in your query's result. If field is not nullable, this will cause the GraphQL query to error.

Ariadne relies on the dedicated `UnionType` class for binding this function to `Union`s in your schema:

```python
from ariadne import UnionType

error = UnionType("Error")

@error.type_resolver
def resolve_error_type(obj, *_):
    ...
```

If this function is already defined elsewhere (e.g. 3rd party package), you can instantiate the `UnionType` with it as the second argument:

```python
from ariadne import UnionType
from .graphql import resolve_error_type

error = UnionType("Error", resolve_error_type)
```

Lastly, your `UnionType` instance should be passed to `make_executable_schema` together with your other types:

```python
schema = make_executable_schema(type_defs, [query, error])
```


## `__typename` field

Every type in GraphQL has a special `__typename` field that is resolved to a string containing the type's name.

Including this field in your query may simplify implementation of result-handling logic in your client:

```graphql
query getFeed {
    feed {
        __typename
        ... on Post {
            text
        }
        ... on Image {
            url
        }
        ... on User {
            username
        }
    }
}
```

Assuming that the feed is a list, the query could produce the following response:

```json
{
    "data": {
        "feed": [
            {
                "__typename": "User",
                "username": "Bob"
            },
            {
                "__typename": "User",
                "username": "Aerith"
            },
            {
                "__typename": "Image",
                "url": "http://placekitten.com/200/300"
            },
            {
                "__typename": "Post",
                "text": "Hello world!"
            },
            {
                "__typename": "Image",
                "url": "http://placekitten.com/200/300"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

Client code could check the `__typename` value of every item in the feed to decide how it should be displayed in the interface.
