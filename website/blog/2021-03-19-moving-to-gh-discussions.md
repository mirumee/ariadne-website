title: Ariadne community is moving to GitHub discussions
---

Hello!

If you've recently visited any Spectrum community, you are likely aware that [GitHub is now sunsetting](https://spectrum.chat/spectrum/general/join-us-on-our-new-journey~e4ca0386-f15c-4ba8-8184-21cf5fa39cf5) Spectrum for GitHub discussions.

Because of this, we've made decision to move Ariadne's community to [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/mirumee/ariadne/discussions)!

Thanks and see you there! ðŸ‘‹
